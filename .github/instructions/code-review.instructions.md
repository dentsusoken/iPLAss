# Code Review Guidelines

Use the following prefixes for your review comments:

[must] - Critical issues requiring mandatory revision
[imo] - Suggestions for improvement (optional modifications)
[ask] - Questions or points needing clarification about the implementation
[nits] - Minor issues or style notes
[fyi] - Information provided for reference

Focus not only on technical aspects but also on:

- Explaining logic changes and their purpose in terms understandable to non-engineers
- Suggesting improvements from readability and maintainability perspectives
- Possibilities for future extensibility and refactoring

## Language

Write the entire review in Japanese.
